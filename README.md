# My Sample Website

Hi there! 👋  
This is my little project while learning Git.  
I’m just practicing how to make changes, save them, and share my work using Git and GitHub.

This page says **hello, world** and also has a short line that says *Call me Ishmael.*  
It’s simple, but it helps me learn how coding and saving files works.

I learned this from the course *Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*.  
It’s a beginner guide that teaches how to use Git step by step —  
and it’s actually kind of fun! 😄

If you want to learn more about Git,  
you can visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/doc).

Thanks for reading my README! 💻
